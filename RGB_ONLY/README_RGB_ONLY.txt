README

This folder contains the code and data used to generate the results found in Section 4 of the main text, and Section 1 of the Supplementary text.  These correspond to experiments which used a Pt. Grey camera that could not acquire depth information.  Per-pixel depth was computed using prior knowledge of scene geometry.  These results were also generated using our "naive carving" algorithm, as opposed to the robust carving algorithm used to generate the results in Section 5 and 6 of the main text and Section 2 of the supplemental.

Current code in this folder is here is a placeholder while I locate the final version of the code used for the ECCV submission.
